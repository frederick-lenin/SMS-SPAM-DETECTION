Have used Logistic Regression and MultinomialNB

### LOGISTICS REGRESSION:
   A process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable.The most common logistic regression models a binary outcome; something that can take two values such as true/false, yes/no, and so on.
   
### MultinomialNB:
  The multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is suitable for classification with discrete features (e.g., word counts for text classification). The multinomial distribution normally requires integer feature counts. However, in practice, fractional counts such as tf-idf may also work.
